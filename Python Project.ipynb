    "Please note that there may be several ways to approach each challenge. If you get stuck, try mapping out your approach in pseudocode first. Finally, while solutions to problems like these may be found online, remember that if you copy/paste code that you can't explain, you'll be missing out on the point of the project. The only way to truly learn a new skill is through practice, trial, and error - we can only help you improve by understanding where you are having trouble."
